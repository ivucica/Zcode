HACKING ZCODE
=============

Just a few notes on coding style, right now. This is primarily what I do,
and open to discussion. While doubtful you'd get me to agree ;-) it's not
written in stone. 

I'd, however, like the patches to adhere to basic coding style outlined here.
Currently these are primarily stylistic notes.

1. Use two spaces for tab

While I don't personally like this formatting, this is what Project Center
does, and what GNUstep primarily uses. So until I get around to replacing
two-spaces with tabs, just use two spaces.

2. Braces newlined, same level as preceding line

An example will be worth more than a thousand words here:
  [someone doSomething];
  if (someCondition)
  {
    // increase indent here
    [something doStuff];
  }
  performOperation();

3. Reasonable spacing

Use newlines to denote separation between logical sections of code. Use
whitespace to denote separation between logical segments of a complex
expression.

4. Self-documenting code and comments

Could a line be less than understandable just because it's a complex
expression full of cryptic variable names? Either self-document by moving
the code in a separate function, or write a comment.

5. Align colons

Your fancy, but complex Objective-C call makes a lot of calls, and
is unreadable in one line? It's ok to split it multiple lines, but please
align the colons:

  [[Something alloc] initWithManyArguments:a
                         someOtherArgument:b
                                 aThirdOne:c];

6. Use camelcase for ObjC identifiers

...butRememberThatTheFirstLetterIsLowercase

7. Use _ to denote private identifiers

_thisIsAPrivateIVar

8. Don't separate colon from argument

  [this isNot: whatIWant];
See point 5. for a correct example :-)


I'm sure I could write down some other info on how I personally prefer
writing code, but the most important one is:

9. Just try being consistent

Trying is also more important than actually being consistent; if you find
something works better than the "consistent" way, just go for it.


Let's all just have fun!
